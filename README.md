# ZMT-More-Editor-Options

Your here because you want to change your units. And change is what your gonna get.

Alright so you need to replace the CSharp with the one here.

After placing your favorite human you can find his identifier number at the top of the menu when you select him.

save the level, leave the editor (it sometimes doesn't work if you dont), Go into the LVL file and search his identifier with ctrl + f,

If you scroll down a bit you will find a bunch of booleans (true or false) which are conveinently labeled

After doing what you need to do (make sure to save it again), you should be done :D




This still isn't done as i'm still searching for more stuff i can potentially mess with. Might find more cool stuff in the future. :)

ps: if you want it gone you can just reinstall the game, it wont hurt nothin
