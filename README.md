# ZMT-More-Editor-Options

Your here because you want to change your units. And change is what your gonna get.

Alright so you need to replace the CSharp with the one here, Once you do that all you have to do is open up your LVL file of choice. 

After finding your favorite human you can find his identifier number at the top of the menu when you select him.

Place him down, save so the lvl file updates, leave the editor (it sometimes doesn't work if you dont),
go into the lvl file and search his identifier with ctrl + f,

If you scroll down a bit you will find a bunch of booleans (true or false) which are conveinently labeled

After doing what you need to do (make sure to save it), you should be done :D




Also thank god that the devs didn't leave behind spaghetti code, most confusing yet organized stuff i've seen
